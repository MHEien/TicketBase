# Deployment Guide

This guide covers the process of deploying the TicketBase platform to a production environment.

## Deployment Strategy

The recommended deployment strategy is to use Docker to containerize each application (`admin`, `api`, `storefront`, etc.). This approach provides a consistent, isolated, and scalable environment for running the platform.

Each application that is intended for deployment has its own `Dockerfile` that defines how to build a production-ready image.

## Dockerfile Analysis

The `Dockerfile` for each application (e.g., `apps/admin/Dockerfile`) follows a multi-stage build pattern to create an optimized and secure final image.

1.  **`deps` Stage**: This stage installs all necessary dependencies. It only copies `package.json` files, so this layer is only rebuilt when dependencies change, which speeds up the build process.
2.  **`builder` Stage**: This stage builds the application. It copies the dependencies from the `deps` stage and the full source code, then runs the `bun run build` command.
3.  **`runner` Stage**: This is the final, production-ready image. It is a lightweight image that copies only the built application artifacts from the `builder` stage. It also creates a non-root user to run the application for improved security.

## Building and Running a Production Container

To build and run a production image for a specific application (e.g., `admin`):

1.  **Build the Docker Image**:
    From the root of the monorepo, run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker build -t tickets-admin:latest -f apps/admin/Dockerfile .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker Container**:
    Once the image is built, you can run it as a container:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --name admin-container tickets-admin:latest
    ```

    This command starts the `admin` application in the background and maps port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.

## Production Environment

In a real-world production environment, you would typically use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or a service like AWS ECS or Google Cloud Run to manage your containers. You would also need to ensure that your production environment provides the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, JWT secrets) to the running containers.
